# Simple Morse Code Translator In Python

Morse code is a method of encoding text characters using a series of dots (•), dashes (—), and spaces. It was developed in the early 19th century by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail as a way to transmit information via telegraph systems.

**Basic Elements**:
* Dot (•): A short signal, typically lasting for one unit of time.
* Dash (—): A longer signal, typically lasting for three units of time.
* Intra-character gap: A short pause (one unit) between dots and dashes within a character.
* Intra-word gap: A medium pause (three units) between characters within a word.
* Inter-word gap: A longer pause (seven units) between words.
